Antelope is a graphical user interface for running <a href="http://ant.apache.org" target="_blank">Ant</a>. While new to tigris.org, Antelope is a mature application that is in wide use as a front end to Apache Ant. Antelope provides a set of buttons, one per target, which makes it easy to start a specific Ant operation. Basically, an Ant build file is opened with Antelope and the targets defined in the build file can be executed by clicking a button. Antelope is much more than a thin wrapper around Ant, however. 
</p>

<p>
Antelope can run in two different environments. It can run as a stand-alone GUI application and as a plugin to jEdit (<a href="http://www.jedit.org" target="_blank">www.jedit.org</a>), an excellent open source editor for programmers. 
</p>

<p>
As a stand-alone application, Antelope provides the ability to create and edit Ant build files, the ability to run build file targets, and can trace target and task execution in a quasi-debug mode. Output from the build process can be captured to a file and/or to screen and performance statistics can be gathered to guide optimization efforts. Several very useful tasks to extend Ant are included. 
</p>

<p>
As a jEdit plugin, Antelope expands the features of the stand-alone application to nicely integrate with the text editor and with the Console and ErrorList plugins. Antelope has an open API that allows other plugins to utilize Antelope's capabilities. 
</p>

<p>
In either mode, Antelope provides property and reference inspection and the ability to set properties that would be passed as parameters to Ant on the command line.
</p>

<p>
The Antelope Project also provides a set of additional tasks that provide functionality not found in the standard tasks distributed with Ant. Work is underway to merge the Antelope tasks with the <a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">AntContrib project</a>.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>To develop an intuitive and easy to use graphical user interface to Ant.
</p>

<p>The scope of the Antelope project is to make creating, testing, and running builds as simple as possible. The goal is to be able to do "one click" operations to perform repetative tasks such as compile source code, run unit tests, generate documentation, and package applications for deployment. Ant is well suited for these tasks, Antelope aims to create a GUI to make it easier to run Ant and to integrate into popular Integrated Development Environments such as jEdit and Eclipse. 
</p>

<h3>Antelope Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stand-alone application or tight integration with jEdit.</li>
<li>Compatible with Ant 1.5 and Ant 1.6, including full support for XML entity includes and the new &lt;import&gt; task.</li>
<li>Run single or multiple targets with one click.<li>
<li>Build progress indicator shows both the progress of the build and the currently executing target.</li>
<li>Edit mode uses JTree for rapid location of targets and tasks, click on a target in the tree and have the editor automatically scroll to that point in the build file. Works on any XML file, not just build files.</li>
<li>Web-browser-like "back" and "forward" buttons in Edit mode make moving around in the build file easy.
<li>Ability to set user defined properties via a graphical interface.</li>
<li>Full access to properties and references.</li>
<li>"Trace" mode provides the ability to run a build without actually doing anything, making it possible to check property values and execution flow prior to running a live build.</li>
<li>Adjustable message level and build progress verbosity for build output, plus the ability to save build output to a file.</li>
<li>Show or hide targets based on several popular target naming schemes.</li>
<li>All settings are stored per build file.</li>
<li>Built-in GUI support for the &lt;input&gt; task.</li>
<li>Special performance listener provides performance profiling to help pinpoint bottlenecks in the build process.</li>
<li>While not intended to be a full-featured text editor, Antelope is a very usable XML file editor. It provides several features found in more advanced editors such as font control and syntax highlighting.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Proposed Enhancements</h3>
<ul>

<li>Ability to print both build files and build output.</li>

<li>Integration with Eclipse.</li>

<li>Drag and drop editing of build files. In the early 90's, Wise made an installation program for Windows. On the left side was a list of items that were dragged to the right side, properties for those items were set, and an installation script was built. Ant targets and tasks could be built in a similar fashion.</li>
</ul>
