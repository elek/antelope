How to run the tests:

The test files are not meant to be ran on their own.  The tests are to be 
ran by running antelope_task_test.xml as an Ant build file.  While the 
individual test files are valid Ant build files, the task definitions are
loaded in antelope_task_test.xml, not in the individual test files.

To run the tests:

ant -f antelope_task_test.xml

There should be no failed tests.
