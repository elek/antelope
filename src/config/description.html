Antelope is a graphical user interface for running Ant. Antelope is a mature application that is in wide use as a front end to Apache Ant. Antelope provides a set of buttons, one per target, which makes it easy to start a specific Ant operation. Basically, an Ant build file is opened with Antelope and the targets defined in the build file can be executed by clicking a button. Antelope is much more than a thin wrapper around Ant, however.
<p>
Antelope can run in two different environments. It can run as a stand-alone GUI application and as a plugin to jEdit (www.jedit.org), an excellent open source editor for programmers.
<p>
As a stand-alone application, Antelope provides the ability to create and edit Ant build files, the ability to run build file targets, and can trace target and task execution in a quasi-debug mode. Output from the build process can be captured to a file and/or to screen and performance statistics can be gathered to guide optimization efforts. Several very useful tasks to extend Ant are included.
<p>
As a jEdit plugin, Antelope expands the features of the stand-alone application to nicely integrate with the text editor and with the Console and ErrorList plugins. Antelope has an open API that allows other plugins to utilize Antelope's capabilities.
<p>
In either mode, Antelope provides property and reference inspection and the ability to set properties that would be passed as parameters to Ant on the command line.
<p>
The Antelope Project also provides a set of additional tasks that provide functionality not found in the standard tasks distributed with Ant.  These tasks are included with the plugin.
