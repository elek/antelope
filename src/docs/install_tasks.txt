Antelope Tasks Installation:

Make sure Ant is installed correctly. Locate the directory where Ant is 
installed. Locate a directory named "lib" in that directory.

Unzip the distribution file. It will create a directory named 
AntelopeTasks_@@build.num@@.

Change to the AntelopeTasks_@@build.num@@ directory. In this directory will be a 
jar file named AntelopeTasks_@@build.num@@.jar.

Copy the jar file to Ant's "lib" directory.
