Antelope Installation:

Make sure Ant is installed correctly and that the Ant startup script is in your path.

Unzip the distribution file. It will create a directory named Antelope_@@build.num@@.

Change to the Antelope_@@build.num@@ directory. In this directory will be a file named "run.xml" and Antelope_@@build.num@@.jar.

From a command prompt, run:

ant -f run.xml
