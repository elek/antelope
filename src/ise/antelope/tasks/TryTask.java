/**
 * Try is a container task - it can contain other Ant tasks. The nested tasks
 * are simply executed in sequence. Try's primary use is to support the
 * try/catch-like execution of a set of tasks. If any of the child tasks fail
 * (that is, they throw a build exception), the exception is caught and the
 * build can continue. This is sometimes useful for tasks that can fail, but it
 * isn't necessary to fail the build if they do. For example, the "mail" task
 * may fail if the server is unavailable, but not sending the message may not be
 * critical to the build continuing.
